### 0.23.0

+ gobjectType now does not require a proxy argument, it needs to be used with TypeApplications instead.

+ Annotated signals are supported: `on widget (signal ::: "detail")`.

+ Safe coercions to parent types supported, with `asA`.

+ Support for GObject subclassing, and registering custom properties.

+ Use TypeApplications in `AttrInfo` implementation, and inherited methods implementation.

+ Add an allocating setting operator `(:&=)`.

+ Support for exporting class structs.

+ IsGValue instances for GObjects and boxed objects.

### 0.22.6

+ Fix generated IsX typeclasses for non-GObject interfaces.

### 0.22.5

+ Add support for inheriting overloading info.

### 0.22.4

+ Do not generate bindings for struct/union fields pointing to private/class structs, which we do not bind.

### 0.22.3

+ Sometimes struct fields marked as not introspectable contain invalid introspection info. We are lenient in these cases with parsing errors, and simply ignore the fields.

### 0.21.5

+ Add support for callback-valued properties.

### 0.21.4

+ Try to guess signedness of enums and flags on the C side, fixes [#184](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/184).

### 0.21.3

+ Do not add nodes in overrides if a node with the same name already exists, fixes [#171](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/171).

### 0.21.2

+ Do not free `Ptr Word8` types after performing the call to C,
since they only get passed along. Otherwise one could easily double free in functions such as [GdkPixbuf.pixbufNewFromData](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gdkpixbuf/docs/GI-GdkPixbuf-Objects-Pixbuf.html#v:pixbufNewFromData).

+ Fix a leak on optional `ScopeTypeAsync` callbacks.

### 0.20.4

+ Improve marshaling of array arguments with no specified size. This improves the generated bindings for various functions, for instance [`GObject.signalEmitv`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gobject/docs/GI-GObject-Functions.html#v:signalEmitv).

+ Replace the enable-overloading flags with a explicit CPP check of the version of `haskell-gi-overloading` we are being compiled against, see [issue 124](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/124) for the rationale.

### 0.20.3

+ Make the overloading code protected by a CPP conditional, depending on ENABLE_OVERLOADING being defined. See [issue 107](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/107).

+ Wrap boxed structs/unions as transient [ManagedPtr](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-gi-base/docs/Data-GI-Base-BasicTypes.html#t:ManagedPtr)s in callbacks. This is needed to fix a number of issues, including [issue 96](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/96) and [issue 97](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/97).

### 0.20.2

+ Fixes for GHC 8.2.1.

### 0.20.1

+ gtk-doc parser and haddock generator: while by no means perfect,
now the autogenerated bindings come with some reasonable
autogenerated documentation.

+ Many bugfixes. A particularly important one is for
[issue 82](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/82), which
made compilation of
[gi-glib](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-glib) fail, for
the latest version of gobject-introspection.
